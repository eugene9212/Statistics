## 1.3 Conditional Probabilitu
- Now, when we want to find the probability $P(A)$ of an event $A$ occurring, we consider how the prior knowledge that event $B$ has occurred changes $P(A)$.
- The definition of the conditional probability $P(A\vert B)$, that is, the probability of $A$ occurring given that $B$ has occurred, is as follows:

#### Definition 1.4 Conditional probability
    Let events A and B be defined on the sample space S. The conditional probability of event A occurring, given that event B has occurred, is
    $$
    P(A\vert B) = frac{P(A\cap B)}{P(B)}
    $$

$$
P(A) = \frac{\text{number of favorable outcomes}}{\text{number of total outcomes}}
$$
